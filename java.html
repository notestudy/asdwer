<h2><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></h2></div>
<p>
  Java is a high level, third generation programming language, like C, FORTRAN, Smalltalk, Perl, and many others. You can use Java to write computer applications that play games, store data or do any of the thousands of other things computer software can do. Compared to other programming languages, Java is most similar to C. However although Java shares much of C's syntax, it is not C. Knowing how to program in C or, better yet, C++, will certainly help you to learn Java more quickly, but you don't need to know C to learnJava. A Java compiler won't compile C code, and most large C programs need to be changed substantially before they can become Java programs. What's most special about Java in relation to other programming languages is that it lets you write special programs called applets that can be downloaded from the Internet and played safely within a web browser. Java language is called as an Object Oriented Programming language and before begining for Java, we have to learn the concept of OOPs(Object Oriented Programming)

<h2><u>FEATURES OF JAVA:</u></h2></div>
As we know that the Java is an object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems of USA in 1991. Java is first programming language which is not attached with any particular hardware or operating system. Program developed in Java can be executed anywhere and on any system
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<b><u>Features of Java are as follows:</u></b>
<li>Compiled and Interpreted</li>
   <li>Platform Independent and portable</li>
     <li>Object oriented</li>
       <li>Robust and secure </li>
         <li> Distributed</li>
           <li>Familiar, simple and small</li>
             <li>Multithreaded and Interactive</li>
               <li>High performance</li>
                 <li>Dynamic and Extensible</li>
</ul>
<dl>
  <dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>1.Compiled and Interpreted:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Basically a computer language is either compiled or interpreted. Java comes together both these approach thus making Java a two-stage system.
  Java compiler translates Java code to Bytecode instructions and Java Interpreter generate machine code that can be directly executed by machine that is running the Java program.
  </dd>
  <dt><b><p style="color:darkblue ;"><u>2.Platform Independent and portable:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java supports the feature portability. Java programs can be easily moved from one computer system to another and anywhere. Changes and upgrades in operating systems, processors and system resources will not force any alteration in Java programs. This is reason why Java has become a trendy language for programming on Internet which interconnects different kind of systems worldwide. Java certifies portability in two ways. First way is, Java compiler generates the byte code and that can be executed on any machine. Second way is, size of primitive data types are machine independent.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>3.Object oriented:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java is truly object oriented language. In Java, almost everything is an Object. All program code and data exist in objects and classes. Java comes with an extensive set of classes; organize in packages that can be used in program by Inheritance. The object model in Java is trouble free and easy to enlarge.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>4.Robust and secure:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java is a most strong language which provides many securities to make certain reliable code. It is design as garbage collected language, which helps the programmers virtually from all memory management problems. Java also includes the concept of exception handling, which detain serious errors and reduces all kind of threat of crashing the system.Security is an important feature of Java and this is the strong reason that programmer use this language for programming on Internet.The absence of pointers in Java ensures that programs cannot get right of entry to memory location without proper approval.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>5.Distributed:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java is called as Distributed language for construct applications on networks which can  contribute both data and programs. Java applications can open and access remote objects on  Internet easily. That means multiple programmers at multiple remote locations to work together on single task.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>6.Familiar, simple and small:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java is very small and simple language. Java does not use pointer and header files, goto  statements, etc. It eliminates operator overloading and multiple inheritance.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>7.Multithreaded and Interactive:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Multithreaded means managing multiple tasks simultaneously. Java maintains multithreaded programs. That means we need not wait for the application to complete one task before starting next task. This feature is helpful for graphic applications.</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>8.High performance:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java performance is very extraordinary for an interpreted language, majorly due to the use of intermediate bytecode. Java architecture is also designed to reduce overheads during runtime. The incorporation of multithreading improves the execution speed of program</dd>
<dt><b><p style="color: darkblue;"><u>9.Dynamic and Extensible:</u></p></b></dt>
<dd>Java is also dynamic language. Java is capable of dynamically linking in new class, libraries, methods and objects. Java can also establish the type of class through the query building it possible to either dynamically link or abort the program, depending on the reply. Java program is support functions written in other language such as C and C++, 
  known as native methods. </dd></dl>

  <h2><u>Java Virtual machine:</u> </H2></div>
    <p>As we know that all programming language compilers convert the source code to machine code.Same job done by Java Compiler to run a Java program, but the difference is that Java compiler convert the source code into Intermediate code is called as bytecode. This machine is called the Java Virtual machine and it exits only inside the computer memory

<div align="center">
  <h2><u>Java Environment:</u> </H2></div>
    <p>Java environment includes a number of development tools, classes and methods. The  development tools are part of the system known as Java Development Kit (JDK) and the classes and methods are part of the Java Standard Library (JSL), also known as the Application Programming Interface (API).
      Java Development kit (JDK) The JDK comes with a set of tools that are used for developing and running Java program. It includes:
      </p>
<ol>
  <li>	Appletviewer( It is used for viewing the applet)</li>
  <li>	Javac(It is a Java Compiler)</li>
    <li>	Java(It is a java interpreter)</li>
      <li>	Javap(Java diassembler,which convert byte code into program description)</li>
        <li>	Javah(It is for java C header files)</li>
          <li>	Javadoc(It is for creating HTML document)</li>
            <li>	Jdb(It is Java debugger)</li>
</ol>
<p>For compiling and running the program we have to use following commands:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>javac (Java compiler) In java, we can use any text editor for writing program and then save that program with  java extension. Java compiler convert the source code or program in bytecode and interpreter convert java file in .class file.
    <br>Syntax:C:\javac filename.java<br>
    If my filename is ―abc.java then the syntax will be<br>
    C:\javac abc.java
    </li>
    <li>java(Java Interpreter) As we learn that, we can use any text editor for writing program and then save that program with ―.java extension. Java compiler convert the source code or program in  bytecode and interpreter convert ―.java‖ file in ―.class‖ file.
     <br> Syntax:C:\java filename
      </li>
</ol>
<img src="images/syntax.png" width="400" height="200">
<div align="center">
  <h2><u>Data Type:</u> </H2></div>
    <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
      Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.
      Data types are the domains which determine what type of contents can be stored in a variable. In java there are two types of data types
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Primitive data types </li>
        <li>Reference data types </li>
      </ol></p>
      <img src="images/data.png" width="700" height="400">
      <ol>
     <li> <u><b>Primitive Data Types:</b></u></li>
       <p> Primitive data types are non grouped pieces of data which can have only one value at a time. They are the simplest built in forms of data in Java. Other data types are made up of combination of primitive data types. Java initializes all primitive data types to default values if an initial value is not explicitly specified by the programmer. Integer and floating-point variables are initialized to 0. The char data type is initialized to null and Boolean data types are set to false. 
The types byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char are called primitive data types , as they are built into the Java language at low level . <br>
<b><u>The primitive data type keywords are as shown: </u></b>
<ol type="i">
  <li>	boolean </li>
    <li>	char </li>
      <li>	byte </li>
        <li>	short </li>
          <li>	int </li>
            <li>	long </li>
              <li>	float </li>
                <li>	double </li>

</ol></p>
<li><u><b>Reference Data Types:</b></u></li>
<p>Reference data types are made by the logical grouping of primitive data types. These are called reference data types because they contain the address of a value rather than the value itself. Arrays, objects, interfaces, enum etc. are examples of reference data types. </p>
<li><u><b>Integer Data Types:</b></u></li>     
<p>There are four integer data types: byte, short, int, and long. Each can handle different ranges of numbers, as shown: </p>
<img src="images/data_value.png" width="600" height="400">
<ul>
  <li><u><b>byte:</b></u></li>
<p>The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 .</p>
<li><u><b>short:</b></u></li>
<p>The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767.</p>
<li><u><b>int:</b></u></li>
<p>The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (inclusive). For integral values, this data type is generally the default choice unless there is a reason (like the above) to choose something else</p>
<li><u><b>long:</b></u></li>
<p>The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive). Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. </p>
</ul>
