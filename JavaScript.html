        Prototype-based Object-oriented - JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. It used prototypes instead of classes. Objects are used to represent the real-world entity in the program.<br>       
        Interpreted Language - JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. It uses a just-in-time compilation technique at run-time.<br>       
        Event-Based Programming - JavaScript allows us to write codes that are executed differently under different events.<br>

<h2 id="why learn javascript">Why We Learn Javascript?</h2>

<p>
    JavaScript is used on both the client-side and the server-side. On the client-side, the code is run and displayed by the browser.<br> On the server-side, Node.js is used.<br>
    
    JavaScript is a platform-independent language.<br> Any browser supporting JavaScript can run the code irrespective of the operating system<br>
    
    JavaScript uses the just-in-time compilation technique.<br> Since the compilation is handled at run time, JavaScript is considered an interpreted language.<br>
    
    JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.<br> That is, a variable containing a number may be reassigned to a string.<br>

    <p>JavaScript Operators

        Here, we will learn about different operators available in JavaScript and how to use them with the help of examples.<br>
        
        In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).<br> For example,
        
        2 + 3; // 5
        
        Here + is an operator that performs addition, and 2 and 3 are operands.

   <h2 id="comment">JavaScript Comments</h2>
   <p>

    In this tutorial, you will learn about JavaScript comments, why you should use them, and how to use them with the help of examples.
    
    JavaScript comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. They are completely ignored by JavaScript engines.
    
   <p> There are two ways to add comments to code:<br>
    
    // - Single Line Comments<br>
    
    /* */ -Multi-line Comments<br>

   </p>

   <p><b>single line comments</b></p>
<p>

Single line Javascript comments start with two forward slashes (//). All text after the two forward slashes until the end of a line makes up a comment, even when there are forward slashes in the commented text.
</p>
<p><b>Multiline Comments</b></p>
 <p>

Javascript multiline comments, also known as block comments, start with a forward slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash (*/). They do not require a comment delimiter character on every line and may contain newlines.
 <br></p>  
 <p>
    

**JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, thus:<br>

Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.<br>

Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.

JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence < !--. JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.-->

The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript so it should be written as //-->.
 </p><br>
 <h2 id="variable">JavaScript variable</h2>
 <p>
    JavaScript variable

Variables are referred as named containers for storing information. We can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.<br>

Rules to declare variable in JavaScript<br>

Here are the important rules that must be followed while declaring a variable in JavaScript.<br>

In JavaScript variable names are case sensitive i.e. a is different from A.<br>

Variable name can only be started with a underscore ( _ ) or a letter (from a to z or A to Z), or dollar ( $ ) sign.<br>

Numbers (0 to 9) can only be used after a letter.<br>

No other special character is allowed in variable name.<br>
 </p><br>
 <h2 id="statement">JavaScript Statement</h2>
 <p>
    javascript Statement are the commands to tell the browser to what action to perform . statement are separated by semicolon(;).<br>
    javascript statement constitutes the javascript code which is translated by the browser line by line </p><br>
    <p><b>example of javascript statement:</b></p><br>
    <table border="">
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Welcome";
    </table><br>
    <p><b>various types of javascript statements:</b></p>
    <table border="">
        <tr><th>sr.no</th><th>statement</th><th>description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1.</td><td>switch case</td><td>A block of statements in which execution of code depends upon different cases. The interpreter checks each case against the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a default condition will be used</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2.</td><td>if else</td><td>The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3.</td><td>while</td><td>The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as expression is true. Once expression becomes false, the loop will be exited.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4.</td><td>do while</td><td>Block of statements that are executed at least once and continues to be executed while condition is true.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5.</td><td>for</td><td>Same as while but initialization, condition and increment/decrement is done in the same line.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6.</td><td>continue</td><td>The continue statement tells the interpreter to immediately start the next iteration of the loop and skip remaining code block.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7.</td><td>break</td><td>The break statement is used to exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8.</td><td>return</td><td>Return statement is used to return a value from a function.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9.</td><td>function</td><td>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your programme. The keyword function is used to declare a function.</td></tr>

    <h2 id="data">Javascript Datatype</h2>
    <p><b>There are two kinds of data types as mentioned below :</b></p>
    <p>1.primitive data type<br></p>
    <p>2.non primitive data type<br></p>
    <p><b>following are describr primitive data type</b></p>
    <p>
        <b>1.String:-</b>
        
        Can contain groups of character as single value. It is represented in double quotes.E.g. var x= “tutorial”.<br>
        
        <b>2.Numbers:-</b>
        
        Contains the numbers with or without decimal. E.g. var x=44, y=44.56;<br>
        
       <b> 3.Booleans:-</b>
        
        Contain only two values either true or false. E.g. var x=true, y= false.<br>
        
        <b>4.Undefined:-</b>
        
        Variable with no value is called Undefined. E.g. var x;<br>
        
        <b>5.Null:-</b>
        
        If we assign null to a variable, it becomes empty. E.g. var x=null;</p><br>
        <p><b>following are describe non primitive data type</b></p><br>
<p>
1.array:<br>
Can contain groups of values of same type. E.g. var x={1,2,3,55};<br>2.Objects:<br>
Objects are stored in property and value pair. E.g. var rectangle = { length: 5, breadth: 3};
        </p>
        <h2 id="func">JavaScript Function</h2>
        <p>

Function is a group of reusable statements (Code) that can be called any where in a program. In javascript function keyword is used to declare or define a function.<br>

Key Points<br>

To define a function use function keyword followed by functionname, followed by parentheses ().<br>

In parenthesis, we define parameters or attributes.<br>

The group of reusabe statements (code) is enclosed in curly braces {}. This code is executed whenever function is called.<br>
        </p>
<h2 id="console">JavaScript console.log()</h2>
<p>
    In this tutorial, you will learn about JavaScript console with the help of examples.<br>
    
    JavaScript console.log()<br>
    All modern browsers have a web console for debugging. The console.log() method is used to write messages to these consoles. For example,</p><br>
    <p>let sum = 44;<br>
        console.log(sum);   // 44</p>
        <p><b>syntax:</b></p>
        <p>console.log() Syntax<br>
            Its syntax is:</p><br>
            <p>console.log(message)</p>
            <p><b>example</b></p>
            <p>print a sentence</p><br>
            <p>// program to print a sentence<br>
                // passing string<br>
                console.log("I love JS");</p><br>
                <h2>JavaScript type conversion</h2>
                <p>
                    In this tutorial, you will learn about type conversions in JavaScript with the help of examples.<br>
                    In programming, type conversion is the process of converting data of one type to another.<br> For example: converting String data to number 
                    </p>
                    <p>                    
                        There are two types of type conversion in JavaScript.<br>              
                        **Implicit Conversion - automatic type conversion<br>                        
                        **Explicit Conversion - manual type conversion</p>
                        <p><b>JavaScript Implicit conversion</b></p>
                        <p>
                            In certain situations, JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another (to the right type). This is known as implicit conversion</p>
                            <p><b>example</b></p>
                            <p>// numeric string used with + gives string type
                                let result;<br>
                                
                                result = '3' + 2; <br>
                                console.log(result) // "32"<br>
                                
                                result = '3' + true;<br> 
                                console.log(result); // "3true"<br>
                                
                                result = '3' + undefined; <br>
                                console.log(result); // "3undefined<br>        
                                result = '3' + null;<br> 
                                console.log(result); // "3null"</p>
                                <p><b>JavaScript Explicit Conversion</b></p>
                                <p>JavaScript Explicit Conversion

                                    You can also convert one data type to another as per your needs. The type conversion that you do manually is known as explicit type conversion.<br>
                                    
                                    In JavaScript, explicit type conversions are done using built-in methods.<br>
                                    
                                    Here are some common methods of explicit conversions.</p>
     <p>Convert to Number Explicitly<br>

        To convert numeric strings and boolean values to numbers, you can use Number().</p>
        <p><b>For example</b></p>
        <p>let result;<br>

            // string to number<br>
            result = Number('324');<br>
            console.log(result); // 324<br>
            
            result = Number('324e-1')<br>  
            console.log(result); // 32.4<br>
            
            // boolean to number<br>
            result = Number(true);<br>
            console.log(result); // 1<br>
            
            result = Number(false);<br>
            console.log(result); // 0</p><br><br>

            <h2 id="concept"> JavaScript Concepts That Every Web Developer Should Know</h2>
            <p>Millions of web pages are built on JavaScript and it’s not going anywhere at least for now.<br> On one side HTML and CSS give styling to the web pages but on the other side, it’s the magic of JavaScript that makes your web page alive. Today this language is not just limited to your web browser.<br> You can also use it for server-side applications. Isn’t it cool to use a single language for both client-side and server-side applications? A single language fulfils both of the purposes and this is the main reason TON of job posting is there for javascript developers in the tech industry.</p> 
            <p>According to Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, Javascript is the #1 programming language. <br>The language is widely used by 95% of all the websites which you can check here. Whether it’s a small startup or a big company, most of them are working on some kind of website or an app that requires a good knowledge of this language. A lot of frameworks and libraries are there for javascript. These frameworks and libraries can be easily learned if your javascript fundamentals are clear.<br> A lot of concepts are confusing and overwhelming for developers but a good knowledge of these concepts will help you in the long run. Frameworks and libraries come and go but the fundamentals always remain the same.<br> It’s easy to build any kind of application and learn any framework and libraries if the fundamentals are clear. Also, it will help you in interviews as well. Let’s discuss some of the basic concepts of javascript which are important to learn for any javascript developer.</p> 
            <p><b>1.Scope</b></p>
            <p>Scope means variable access. What variable do I have access to when a code is running? In javascript by default, you’re always in root scope i.e. the window scope.<br> The scope is simply a box with a boundary for variables, functions, and objects. These boundaries put restrictions on variables and determine whether you have access to the variable or not. It limits the visibility or availability of a variable to the other parts of the code. You must have a clear understanding of this concept because it helps you to separate logic in your code and also improves the readability.<br> A scope can be defined in two ways…</p> 
            <p>1.Local Scope allows access to everything within the boundaries (inside the box)</p>
            <p>2.Global Scope is everything outside the boundaries (outside the box). A global scope can not access a variable defined in local scope because it is enclosed from the outer world, except if you return it.</p>
            <p><b>2.IIFE</b></p>
            <p>2. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
                As the name suggests IIFE is a function in javascript which immediately invoked and executed as soon as it is defined.<br> Variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world and this way you can avoid the global scope from getting polluted. So the primary reason to use IIFE is to immediately executes the code and obtain data privacy.</p>
             <p><b>example</b></p>
             <P>
                let paintcolor='red'<br>
                const paint=(()=> {<br>
                    return{<br>
                    change color to blue:()=>{<br>
                        paint color: 'blue';<br>
                        return paintcolor;<br>
                    },<br>
                change color to green :()=>{<br>
                    paint color: 'green';<br>
                    return paintcolor;<br>
                }<br>
            }}<br>
                )();<br>
                console.log(<br>
                    paint.changecolor to blue()<br>
                );<br>
                red<br>
             </P>
             <p><b>3.Hoisting</b></p>
             <p>
A lot of developers get unexpected results when they are not clear with the concept of Hoisting in javascript. In javascript, you can call a function before it is defined and you won’t get an error ‘Uncaught ReferenceError’.<br> The reason behind this is hoisting where the javascript interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current scope (function scope or global scope) before the code execution. Let’s understand this with an example. </p>

<p><b> Take a look at the code given below.</b></p>
<p>
    function cowsays(sound){<br>
console.log(sound);<br>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>
<p>
    var a = 5; console.log(5); output: // 3<br>
    The above code with hoisting will give you the same output.<br> 
    a = 5; console.log(5); var a; output // 5</p>
    <p><b>4.closures</b></p>
    <p>
A closure is simply a function inside another function that has access to the outer function variable. Now, this definition sound pretty much straightforward but the real magic is created with the scope.<br> The inner function (closure) can access the variable defined in its scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), in the scope of its parent function, and the global variables.<br> Now here you need to remember that the outer function can not have access to the inner function variable (we have already discussed this in the scope concept). Let’s take an example and understand it in a better way.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Now the question is why do we need to learn closures? What’s the use of it? Closures are used when you want to extend behaviour such as passing variables, methods, or arrays from an outer function to an inner function.<br> In the above example, second() extends the behaviour of the function first() and also has access to the variable ‘greet’.<br> 
        Javascript is not pure object-oriented language but you can achieve object-oriented behaviour through closures.<br> In the above example, you can think of const ‘newFunc’ as an Object having properties ‘greet’ and ‘second()’ a method as in an OOP language. 
        
    </p>
    Here you need to notice that after the first() statement is executed,<br> variables inside the first() function will not be destroyed (even if it has a ‘return’ statement) because of closures as the scope is kept alive here and the child function can still access the properties of the parent function. So closures can be defined in simple terms as “a function run, the function executed. It’s never going to execute again but it’s going to remember that there are references to those variables so the child scope always has access to the parent scope.”</p>
    <p>
        const first =() =>{<br>
            const green='hi';<br>
            const second=()=>{<br>
                const name='john';<br>
                console.log(green);<br>
            }<br>
            return second;<br>
        }<br>
        const newfunc=first();<br>
        <undefined<br>
        >newfunc();<br>
    hi<br>
    </undefined><br>
    </p>
    <p><b>5.callbacks</b></p>
    <p>
        In javascript, a callback is simply a function that is passed to another function as a parameter and is invoked or executed inside the other function. Here a function needs to wait for another function to execute or return a value and this makes the chain of the functionalities (when X is completed, then Y is executed, and it goes on.).<br> This is the reason callback is generally used in the asynchronous operation of javascript to provide the synchronous capability.</p>
        <p><b>6.promises</b></p>
        <p>
            We understand the concept of callback but what will happen if your code will have callbacks within callbacks within callbacks and it goes on. Well, this recursive structure of callback is called ‘callback hell’ and promises to help to solve this kind of issue.<br> Promises are useful in asynchronous javascript operations when we need to execute two or more back-to-back operations (or chaining callback), where each subsequent function starts when the previous one is completed. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future, either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved (rejected). According to developer.mozilla “A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.<br> Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.”. Promises resolve the issue of ‘callback hell’ which is nothing but a recursive structure of callbacks (callbacks within callbacks within callbacks and so forth). <br>
            A promise may be in three possible states… <br>
            
             
            
            Fulfilled: When the operation is completed successfully.<br>
            Rejected: When the operation is failed.<br>
            Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.<br>
            </p>
<p><b>7.Async & Await</b></p>
<p>

Stop and wait until something is resolved. Async & await just syntactic sugar on top of Promises and like promises it also provides a way to maintain asynchronous operation more synchronously.<br> So in javascript asynchronous operations can be handled in various versions… <br>
 

ES5 -> Callback<br>
ES6 -> Promise<br>
ES7 -> async & await<br>
You can use Async/await to perform the Rest API request where you want the data to fully load before pushing it to the view.<br> For Nodejs and browser programmers async/await is a great syntactic improvement. It helps the developer to implement functional programming in javascript<br> and it also increases the code readability.

<h2 id="features">Features Of JavaScript</h2>
<p><b>Features Of JavaScript<br>
    JavaScript main features are as follows –</b></p>
    <p>1. Validating User’s Input<br>
        JavaScript is very useful while using forms. It has the capability to validate user input for errors and also saves time.<br> If the user leaves a required field empty or the information is incorrect,<br> JavaScript checks for them before sending the data over to the server.</p>
        <p>
            2. Simple Client-side Calculations <br>      
            Since JavaScript is a client-side technology, it can perform basic calculations on the browser.<br> The browser does not need to ask server time for every task. This is especially helpful when a user needs to perform these calculations repeatedly.<br> In these cases, connecting to the server would take a lot more time than performing the actual calculations.</p>
            <p>3. Greater Control<br>
                JavaScript provides greater control to the browser rather than being completely dependent on the web servers. <br>JavaScript provides various browsers with additional functionalities that help reduce server load and network traffic.</p>
                <p>4. Platform Independent<br>
                    Since browsers interpret JavaScript, it solves the problem of compilation and compatibility.<br> Thus it can run on Windows, Macintosh, and other Netscape-supported systems. Also, it is possible to embed them in any other script like HTML that keeps JavaScript into use.</p>
   <p>5. Handling Dates and Time<br>
    Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript has built-in functions to determine the date and time. Thus it is very easy to code only by using methods like .getDate().</p> 
    <p>6. Generating HTML Content<br>
        JavaScript has very handy features to dynamically generate HTML content for the web. It allows us to add text, links, images, tables, etc after an event occurrence (eg – mouse click).</p>
   <p>7. Detecting the User’s Browser and OS<br>
    JavaScript is very capable in the detection of the user’s browser and OS information. Though JavaScript runs on every platform, there may occur a situation where we need the user’s browser before processing.<br> This can be helpful for writing code that results in different outputs in different browsers.</p>
